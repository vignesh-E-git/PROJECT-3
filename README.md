#### Concepts used 
* <mark>*MAGIC METHODS*</mark> : I used some of the dunder methods also called magic methods in python.
    * __ add __ : To modify ***add*** opertion to ***subtraction*** operation
    * __ sub __ : To modify ***subtraction*** to ***add*** operation
    * Similarly for ***multiply*** to ***division*** and ***division*** to ***multiplication***
Thats why it is called **reverse woorking calculator.**
